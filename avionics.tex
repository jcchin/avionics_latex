\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
This research was initiated as risk reduction for the NASA
Gondola for High Altitude Planetary Science (GHAPS) mission.
High altitude balloon missions carrying expensive science payloads
across harsh, difficult-to-access locations could greatly benefit from
improved descent and landing systems with the ability to mitigate landing
loads and improve general recoverability.

As a first step, the Rocket University development program developed a series
of payloads of increasing capability to monitor and evaluate various recovery
systems. Comprised mainly of consumer-of-the-shelf (COTS) electronics and
open-source software, this paper offers a few turn-key solutions for highly
cost-constrained science missions. Rather than re-inventing the wheel, these
solutions leverage open-source microcontroller platforms with large ecosystems
that offer both flexibility and simplicity.


\subsection{Balloon Sub-System Basics}

A vast multitude of HAB related resources exist online, therefore many of the
ancillirary subsystems are only breifly outlined here. With many amatuer missions
focused on videography, this work addresses data aquisition and power management;
two disciplines that scale to a wide range of balloon mission.

\subsubsection{Power and Thermal}

Payloads endure extremely cold temperatures, making the most common battery
types undesirable. As temperature decreases, voltage and overall battery
capacity also decreases, often dropping off extremely fast after reaching a specific
temperature threshold. With ambient temperatures reaching down to -75\degree C,
passive inuslation or active heating can greatly improve battery capacity.
Many balloon applications with active heating and radio transmitters also draw
current on the order of amps. Much like cold temperatures, high power draw can
also disproportionately reduce battery life. 

Lithium Sulfer Dioxide (LiSO2) non-rechargeable batteries have been found to 
satisfy all of the typical HAB requirements. They can sustain relatively high
current draw, are resistant down to -40\degree C and their high energy density
is desirable for lighter-than-air applications.
This particular battery chemistry is rated for many space and
medical applications, and are the primary battery type flown by the Columbia
Scientific Balloon Facility.

Using passive thermal insulation alone can capture enough waste heat from the
battery bank to maintain -40\degree C, and on small payloads, chemical heat
from hand-warmers are a popular and extremely simple supplemental heat source.
Waste heat from transmitters and other on-boad electronics can also be used to
keep the payload warm. Given the extremely rarified air at high altitudes,
heat is primarily transferred by direct thermal conduction and radiation.
The lack of convection can be a double-edged sword, helping electronics retain
heat in some cases, but also making it difficult to release unwanted heat
without heat sinks or radiators.

Small scale missions are often airborne on the order of six hours,
requiring multiple batteries connected in both series and parallel.
When building battery banks it's important to consider variations between
battery cells, which become exacerbated by high loads and low temperatures.
Without sophisticated circuitry, it is generally not advisable to connect
batteries into more than two parallel strings. Power across each string is more
likely to become increasingly unbalanced, after a single string starts to degrade.
This creates a positive feedback loop, which can ultimately lead to a dangerous
thermal run-away. With D-cell sized batteries being the limit for most consumer
batteries, this puts a natural limit on the Amp-hour capacity of amatuer flights.


\subsubsection{Telemetry}

The ability to recieve live wirelessly transmitted data from a payload is
essential for the recoverability of any balloon launch. FindMeSpot is the easiest
COTS tracking device, requiring no configuration or operator licenses.
Communication via cell phone devices also offers slightly more flexibility,
but additional configuration and complexity.
Both of these methods are limited to 40,000ft altitude celings.
To maintain constant communication up to 100,000+ feet requires higher powered radios.
The most accessible amatuer radios require an operator with an amatuer HAM license.
These licenses require taking an exam (technical difficulty on par with a
driving exam) from a local amatuer radio chapter. Many free online resources and study
guides provide an easy way to master the finite pool of possible written quiz
questions in a few weeks time. After passing the written test, the basic
technician license is granted by the FCC within a few weeks. Additional licenses
can be obtained by taking increasingly difficult written exams, allowing the
operation of higher powered radios over a larger range of frequencies.

The most popular balloon radio protocol, Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)
provides a very succinct transmission including the balloons GPS lat, lon, heading,
and operator call-sign. By commiting to this protocol, the operator is able to
leverage a large amount of pre-existing HAM radio infrastrucutre. Rather than
relying exclusively on personal ground station equipment, many other amatuer
stations are constantly listening for the APRS frequency and protocol. If the
signal reaches any of these stations, the signal will be repeated and re-broadcasted
to neighboring stations. Eventually the signal will reach an internet ``gateway''
where it is published to various web applications and databases.
This allows an APRS operator to simply broadcast signals,
without the direct need for any reciever equipment.
As long as the signal reaches neighboring HAM stations, the call-sign and information
will be available in real-time from any internet connected device.
For more direct reception and faster feedback,
many affordable handheld recievers are available that can
be tuned to filter out all incoming signals except APRS messages from specfic
call-signs.

If the payload requires more advanced telemetry, leveraging other frequencies
and protocols may be more suitable. If a constant transmission
(possibly bi-directional) communication link or higher bandwidth is needed,
amatuer remote control UAV radio components may be a better option.
With balloon operations requiring extremely long-distance communication,
the most ideal frequencies reside in the UHF range.
As a general rule, transmission bandwith increases and range decreases with
increasing frequency. 900Mhz is ideal for
basic telemetry in the 100-200 kbps range up to 40 miles away. Radio modems
include the RFD900, and Xtend900. These specific models are identified for their
drop-in compatibility with existing hobby level UAV ecosystems that are outlined
in subsequent sections. They are only export controlled, require only
a basic technician's license, and require a minimal amount of radio and 
programming experience.

FAA regs: NOTAM, etc

Developing FAA regulations (as of February 2015) limit small UAS (\<55lbs) to
line of site flight, \<500 ft altitude ceiling, daylight operation, operator certification,
and additional restrictions in various airspaces (such as 5 mile radii around airports)
without notifying air traffic control or further FAA exemption.
A separate, ``more felxible'', set of regulations are under considerations
for ``micro UAS'' class aircraft that fall under 4.4 lbs.
Although it's unclear how balloon systems overlap with UAS, the development
of guided descent and recovery systems certainly fall under both categories,
with even more stringent restrictions applied to vehicles used for commercial gain.
[\cite{FAAuav}]


\section{Avionics for Multiple Cost Levels}

Microcontrollers and systems on a chip (SoC) have improved significantly in 
compute power, accessibility, and cost over the past few years.
Initially driven by hobby electronics, an extremely broad community of developers
have emerged, blurring the lines between amatuer and professional systems for
many applications. The new economies of scale, trickle-down smartphone
technology, Internet-of-Things (IoT) movement, and beginner friendly developer
tools have made high-performance sensing platforms accessible to anyone.

The choice of hardware outlined here is separated into various pricing teirs,
each optimized for rapid development time and extensibility.

\subsection{Sub \$300 launches}

Pico-HABS represent the most extreme type of balloon flight possible.
These payloads are measured on the order of grams, and designed to be nuetrally
bouyant with the lift generated from large party balloons. Although they cannot
reach extremely high altitudes, or carry any consequential amounts of payload,
they can be outfitted with extremely basic sensors and communication equipment.
Sucessful launches costing less than \$100 have been demonstrated with balloons
capable of traveling 30,000ft high and over 4000 miles in a single flight,
while maintaining radio contact.
\cite{Leo} \cite{Amsat}
Although extremely limited individually,
these balloons could serve useful purposes in distributed swarms.

Micro-HABS have been popularized by high school and colleges, and are often used
to take still and video footage from up to 100,000 ft for less
than \$300. These payloads require larger latex balloons, with significantly
more helium. Payloads on the order of a few pounds should be congizant of safety
concerns, avoiding highly trafficed air-space and landing zones.
Higher cost launches, outlined below, also often fall under the six pound
category, however the exponential increase in helium and balloon cost places
them in their own category.

\section{Visualizing Results}


\subsection{Dynamic Visualizations}

Processing is a programming language and development environment designed
with visualization in mind. For this project, it was used to sync video
footage with visualized sensor data. The program embeds the video and syncs
the framerate with rows of sensor data from a CSV. At 30 frames per second,
it reads a new row from the CSV file every 6 frames, updating the display.

Maybe mention HighFlite type projects?

\subsection{Excel, Matlab, Python}

Basic operations necessary to clean, graph, analyze data goes here.

\subsection{Data Dissemination}

Google Fusion Tables, Github, etc

\section{Final Remarks}
The sensor packages outlined in this paper are inconsequential in weight and
compatible for payloads of many sizes up to thousands of pounds.
These systems were originally intended for passive monitoring systems, however the final avionics system outlined could be used to control an active descent system.

Payloads falling under the FAA exempt payload regulation offer exponentially
lower costs with vastly fewer restrictions.
