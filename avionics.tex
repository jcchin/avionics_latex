\section{Introduction and Motivation}


\subsection{Design Cycle Overview}

	From a life-cycle perspective, there comes a point when the prospect of re-design becomes
prohibitively expensive and initial design decisions become cemented into the design. Any insights
gained from more detailed analyses are constrained to these initial design choices. Naturally, a
tradeoff exists on the amount of time spent in each analysis phase. Spending more time in the low
fidelity phase could have large payoffs in the long run; however, without higher fidelity models
it is hard to identify possible shortcomings such as those arising from operability and control
issues.
